webWaiter
=========

A simple threaded HTTP server

I wrote webWaiter at Hacker School during batch[3]
this was my intro to sockets and threads. Feel free
to fork this and do what ever you want! I really want
to get around to fixing all the incomplete features.

#Compiling and Configuring
webWaiter is cofigured at compile time. To change any options
edit the config.h file and change what you need.

The just `make` and you have the binary! I didn't include an
install as this is more intended for learning not real usage
